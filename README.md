# Stance Detection using RNN

In this project, I built a Stance detection system for tweets posted on the social media site twitter (currently known as X). Given a tweet and a particular topic, the Stance detection system will be able to decipher whether the the tweet is for, against or neutral towards the topic. In order to do this we will build a deep learning classification model which will take in two inputs - The tweet and The target topic - and classify the tweet into one of the following classes i.e stances - FAVOR, AGAINST or NONE. We will limit our model to consider only 5 politically charged target topics which are listed below:

1) Atheism 
2) the Feminist Movement 
3) Climate Change is a Real Concern 
4) Legalization of Abortion 
5) Hillary Clinton
